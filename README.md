3D Magnetic Field Visualizer

Visualizes the magnetic fields created by placing one or more solenoids or wires with varying currents in a 3D space.

The magnetic field is determined by integrating with the law of Biotâ€“Savart. The resolution of the integration is very high, but to avoid lag components the objects are drawn at a much lower resolution on the screen.

The colored arrows represent the magnetic field vectors. The bluer they are, the stronger the field at that point.

The view can be moved by dragging in the view window, and the magnitude of the magnetic field at a specific point can be seen by entering coordinates into the X, Y, and Z text fields. Feel free to try diagonals.

Similarly, to add a new magnetic element to the simulation, the relevant information should be inputted into the text fields to the direct left of the wire and solenoid buttons, and then the images should be clicked.

The red X will delete the last element added.
